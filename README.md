MyView
===================


## ViewPager
- [x] Scrollable
- [x] Setting image on tab bar
- [MainActivity]

## Refreshable ListView
  - [x] Add a header
  - [x] Add a footer (in this case, showing a progressbar) to load more items when it reaches end.
  > **Note:**
  > 1. Requesting data from server at a time, but splitting the data into some groups to fill in ListView.
  > 2. It also avoids OOM when you've got a lot of images to show, because it increases heap by the first group of items if you don't scroll the ListView.
  > 3. Using Universal-Image-Loader, Volley and others libraries to load images.
  - [x] Pull to refresh


## Refreshable GridView
